# DB25 Parser - 5 Fundamental Fixes Summary

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Expression Parsing for All Operators
- Added support for bitwise operators: `|`, `&`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`
- Added proper precedence levels for all operators
- String concatenation `||` has precedence 3
- Bitwise operators have precedence 2
- Comparison operators have precedence 4
- Arithmetic operators have precedence 5-6

**File Modified:** `src/parser/parser.cpp` lines 2165-2189

### 2. ✅ Implemented CAST Expression
- Added `parse_cast_expression()` function
- Supports syntax: `CAST(expression AS type)`
- Handles type parameters: `VARCHAR(100)`, `DECIMAL(10,2)`
- Accepts both keywords and identifiers as data types

**Files Modified:** 
- `src/parser/parser.cpp` lines 2681-2766 (new function)
- `include/db25/parser/parser.hpp` line 196 (declaration)

### 3. ✅ Added String Concatenation Operator ||
- Implemented `||` operator for string concatenation
- Set appropriate precedence (level 3)
- Works in all expression contexts

**File Modified:** `src/parser/parser.cpp` line 2178

### 4. ✅ Support for Common SQL Functions
- Parser already supported function calls with keyword names
- Functions like CONCAT, COALESCE, SUBSTRING, TRIM work automatically
- Any keyword followed by `(` is treated as a function call

**Note:** EXTRACT function with `FROM` keyword inside parentheses has limitations due to FROM being a clause terminator.

### 5. ✅ Fixed CTE Recursion with UNION
- CTEs with UNION/UNION ALL now parse correctly
- Recursive CTEs work as expected
- Proper handling of parentheses in CTE definitions

## Test Results

```
Testing: Bitwise and arithmetic operators          ✓ PASSED
Testing: String concatenation with ||              ✓ PASSED  
Testing: CAST with various types                   ✓ PASSED
Testing: Common functions                          ⚠ PARTIAL (EXTRACT needs special handling)
Testing: Recursive CTE with UNION ALL              ✓ PASSED
Testing: All features combined                     ✓ PASSED

Results: 5/6 tests fully passing
```

## Known Limitations

1. **EXTRACT Function**: The syntax `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)` doesn't parse correctly because FROM is treated as a clause terminator inside function arguments. This would require special handling for EXTRACT or a context-aware expression parser.

2. **Other Special Functions**: Functions with non-standard syntax (like POSITION, OVERLAY) may have similar issues.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact from these changes
- Additional operator checks add negligible overhead
- CAST expression parsing is efficient
- No changes to core tokenizer or memory allocator

## Next Steps

To fully support EXTRACT and similar functions:
1. Add context tracking for function argument parsing
2. Or implement special cases for functions with keyword arguments
3. Consider a more sophisticated expression parser that understands SQL function signatures

## Files Changed
